    <p><strong>"Walking on water and developing software from a specification are 
        easy if both are frozen." -- <em>Edward V Berard </em> </strong> <br>
        <br> Computers have always been a thing of fascination for me; be it exploring basic apps like 
        MS Paint during my early childhood or gaining cognizance of the emergence of areas like 
        artificial intelligence and web development during my undergraduate degree, 
        I have been exposed to both the fundamentals and advanced concepts of computer science throughout my academic career. 
        <br> <br> I'm a highly motivated programmer boasting 2+ years of experience in Full-stack development 
        and passionate towards problem solving and designing an application with expertise in
        spearheading, collaborating, and interacting within a team environment showcasing 
        exceptional skills in programming languages and frameworks with a record of 
        enhancing performance and productivity of various projects. My expertise lies in the 
        areas of problem-solving, design-principal application, and Model View Controller (MVC) 
        approaches to the structure of software applications. So far, I've worked and gained 
        knowledge in Java, C++, Python, SpringBoot, Apache Tomcat, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, 
        Kubernetes, Docker, Amazon Web Services, SDLC methodologies, CI/CD and Git/GitHub. 
        I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or 
        principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
