                <p><strong>"Walking on water and developing software from a specification are 
                    easy if both are frozen." -- <em>Edward V Berard </em> </strong> <br>
                    <br> Computers have always been a thing of fascination for me; be it exploring basic apps like 
                    MS Paint during my early childhood or gaining cognizance of the emergence of areas like 
                    artificial intelligence and web development during my undergraduate degree, 
                    I have been exposed to both the fundamentals and advanced concepts of computer science throughout my academic career. 
                    <br> <br> I'm a highly motivated programmer boasting 2+ years of experience in Full-stack development 
                    and passionate towards problem solving and designing an application with expertise in
                    spearheading, collaborating, and interacting within a team environment showcasing 
                    exceptional skills in programming languages and frameworks with a record of 
                    enhancing performance and productivity of various projects. My expertise lies in the 
                    areas of problem-solving, design-principal application, and Model View Controller (MVC) 
                    approaches to the structure of software applications. So far, I've worked and gained 
                    knowledge in Java, C++, Python, SpringBoot, Apache Tomcat, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, 
                    Kubernetes, Docker, Amazon Web Services, SDLC methodologies, CI/CD and Git/GitHub. 
                    I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or 
                    principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head.
